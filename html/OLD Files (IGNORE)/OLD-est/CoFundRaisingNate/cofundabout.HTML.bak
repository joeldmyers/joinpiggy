                        <p>With <strong>ForTheSchools.com</strong> CoFundraising provides <u>all</u> K-12 private, public, or charter schools, Colleges, booster clubs, PTA/PTO’s, bands, drama clubs and… 
                        	the list goes on and on, with a unique concept in charitable giving… <strong>Automatic Fundraising.</strong> As parents, we’ve witnessed first-hand the countless hours 
                        	involved in creating a fundraising campaign.  We’ve also walked the neighborhoods with our children while they sell door to door and we’ve solicited friends, co-workers 
                        	and relatives again and again to contribute to another “thon” of one sort or another.  <br><br>
                        	At ForTheSchools.com, you <strong>don’t do anything</strong> you don’t already do.  
                        	Just make a purchase at one of over 1,000 online stores and <strong>we contribute</strong> a percentage of that purchase back <strong>to your School</strong> or group… 
                        	Automatically.  No one needs to save 
                        	receipts, cut out box tops or mail in rebate forms, it all automated! We also have an ever growing suite of tools designed to help schools and groups fundraise even more 
                        	efficiently, engage with their parents,  and increase parental volunteerism! We put the Fun in <strong>Fun</strong>draising!

                        <p><strong>CoFundraising</strong> has created a completely new and separate revenue stream for <strong>charitable organizations</strong>.  
                        	Instead of tapping into the shrinking pool of money earmarked for charity, 
                        	we utilize the activity of online shopping already done by millions of Americans each day, then <strong> we donate to your charity</strong> a percentage of that transaction back to the charity, 
                        	automatically! <br><br>
                        	Just like with the schools, there’s nothing for you to do aside from deposit your check. Right now we are only set up for churches, <strong>ForTheChurches.com</strong>, 
                        	but stop back very soon as we grow we will be branching out into other sectors!

                    	<h3>Our Goal is to Help People with Automatic Fundraising</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>CoFundraising</strong> family of web properties was founded with the idea of making fundraising easier for schools, groups, parents, and kids.  
                        	Rather than sending our children door to door selling candy bars, gift wrap, or cheesecake we created an easier and safer way for groups to take advantage of 
                        	something their members already do,<strong> shop online</strong>. <br><br>
                        	Each time someone makes a purchase at one of over 1,000 participating online merchants (and growing), we contribute 
                        	a percentage of each sale directly to the charity of your choice, or in the case of our <strong>cash back </strong>websites, back to you!
